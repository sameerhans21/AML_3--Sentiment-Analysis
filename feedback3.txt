Thank you for your submission!

This is a very fine piece of work, well organized and clear. You did well on model selection, but I don't have many details about the fine tuning procedure. Performance wise your models scored well. The data preparation is quite classic, which is fine but not surprising.

There is one main point I'm not comfortable with: it appears you used the "selected_text" instead of the tweet itself, which was not the right strategy. Indeed, "selected_text" was to be used *only* for the bonus task, whereas it should not have been used for the classification task, as there is information leakage.
